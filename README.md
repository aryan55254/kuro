# kuro

attempt at making a small operating system that can run doom and has its own kernel space tcp/ip stack , written in C++

# directory structure

# Phase 1 features  (currently building through phase 1)

1. Multitasking: Switch between processes to allow multiple applications to share the CPU.

2. Exception handler: Handle events requiring OS intervention.

3. Paging: Provide an isolated memory address space for each application.

4. System calls: Allow applications to call kernel features.

5. Device drivers: Abstract hardware functionalities, such as disk read/write.

6. File system: Manage files on disk.

7. Command-line shell: User interface for humans.

# Phase 2 features  

1. Interrupt handling

2. Timer processing

3. Inter-process communication

4. Multi-processor support

# Phase 3 features

- not sure exactly what but all shit that allows to play single player doom 

# Phase 4 features

- not sure exactly what but all shit that allows to play multi-player doom 

- kernel space tcp/ip stack to allow some network shit 

# if you try to test this shit with whatever it is done then the run.sh expects the OpenSBI firmware , will add proper running and setup instructions later after all of phase 1 is done atleast
